                    At face value, Connect 4 is a very simple game. Players take turns placing pieces into columns,
                    with the first player to make 4 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally winning. However,
                    with over 4.5 trillion board states, this game allows for complex strategies to force your opponent
                    into a losing position. This makes Connect 4 ideal for players of all ages.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Connect 4 is not accessible to all. Individuals who are blind or have difficulty
                    moving the pieces may find it challenging to play with either the physical board or existing
                    online versions. We’ve developed a program to let such players play Connect 4 without touching
                    or seeing the board.

                    Our solution came in two major parts: 
                    <strong>a reinforcement learning model</strong> and 
                    <strong>an accessible UI</strong>. Each posed its own challenges.

                    <strong>DQN Model Training:</strong>  
                    Initial single-model DQN struggled beyond basic play. Splitting into two models (first-player and second-player)
                    improved vertical threat blocking, but horizontal and diagonal defense lagged. We tweaked rewards,
                    epsilon decay, network depth, and replay buffer design—but training time and compute limits constrained us.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Hybrid Approaches:</strong>  
                    We experimented with AlphaZero-style MCTS (too heavy), DQN with hard-coded blocks, and eventually
                    a “perfect” solved-game API to guide training. The final model uses the solved-game API to teach
                    itself, yielding strong play without hand-coding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Accessible UI:</strong>  
                    Designed to accept <em>voice commands</em> for column selection and a “read board” command for
                    blind players. Due to Colab’s audio limitations, we prototyped in a local Jupyter/VS Code setup
                    using pre-recorded audio files to demonstrate the concept.

                    <strong>Perfect Play:</strong> A Mini-Max or full MCTS implementation could guarantee optimal moves.
                    A difficulty slider could introduce randomness to make play more approachable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Enhanced UI:</strong> Integrate with a live speech-to-text / text-to-speech engine for real-time
                    voice interaction. Expand to other board games to improve accessibility across the hobby gaming space.
